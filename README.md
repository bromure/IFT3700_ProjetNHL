# NHL Data Exploration and Visualization

The focus is on **data wrangling**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and building **visualizations** (both simple and interactive) to better understand trends in hockey performance.

---

## Milestone 1 Overview
- Collected **aggregated player statistics** (season-level data).  
- Collected **play-by-play data** (detailed sequences of in-game events).  
- Cleaned and structured the raw data for analysis.  
- Built visualizations to highlight patterns in player and game performance.  
- Designed interactive exploration tools to debug and better understand the data.  

This project demonstrates skills in:
- **Data wrangling & cleaning** (Python, Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Data visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- **Working with APIs** (retrieving structured JSON data from the NHL stats API)  
- **Reproducible workflows** (requirements file, virtual environments, modular code)
